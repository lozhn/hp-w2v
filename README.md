While PyData Amsterdam 2024 was not that interesting, I wrote kind-of word2vec (cbow) as I understood it. I didn't care about anything but to kill some time and train a small NN on a M2 Pro.

1. Run `data.py` to preprcoess `hp.txt` into vocabs and word-to-index and index-to-word
2. Run `train.py` to start far-from-optimal train loop
3. Run `run.py` like `python run.py 'harry+ron-hermione'` to get top-5 words that are close in the learned space
